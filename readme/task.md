Data Analyst. Test task.

# Objective
Evaluate the impact of X stimulation in heart rate (HR) metrics based on data collected from users, who have integrated their wearable health trackers with the X app.

# Background
It is well established that vagus nerve stimulation, such as that provided by X, can influence heart rate by decreasing it. X app users can now connect their wearable devices to monitor how the device affects their health metrics, including HR. These HR readings are transmitted to the database every 30 seconds. 

# Data Provided
The dataset is organized into the following files within the folder:
- User X session data: contains records of X sessions.
- User health metrics samples: contains detailed HR metrics sampled at 30-second intervals.
- User health metrics daily: summarized daily health metrics for users.
- Info.txt: explains how to match user IDs across the session data and health metrics data.

# Task requirements
Analyze the provided data to address the following:
- Primary question: does X stimulation affect heart rate metrics? If so, detail the observed effect (e.g., HR increase, HR decrease, duration of impact, etc.)
- Secondary insights: identify any additional patterns, trends, or findings that emerge from the data

# Deliverables:
- A comprehensive report detailing Your findings. 
- Insights into the effect of X stimulation on HR metrics.
- Any notable trends or observations beyond the primary analysis
